Table tennis also helps improve your eye coordination. It is really fun and is a great pass time. You dont have to play the serious normal way you can be all creative if you wanted like playing with a badmington racket? using your other had? play with fans on? instead of a paddle use a chair? any way you want to play table tennis there is fun way to.  </p> </section>
